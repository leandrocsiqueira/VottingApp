# Voting App

### Brief Description

In this project, I developed a simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) voting application inspired by [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

Like those sites, in the app you can up-vote products. All products are sorted instantaneously by number of votes.

I also used [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.

### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

```
npm install
```

3. Boot the HTTP server

```
npm run server
```

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
